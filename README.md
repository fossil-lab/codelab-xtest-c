# Fossil Learning Platform (FLLP) Codelab Template

## Abstract:

Welcome to the Fossil Learning Platform (FLLP) Codelab Template! This template is designed to help you create interactive and educational codelabs that utilize the Fossil Logic Libraries (FLL) within the Fossil Learning Platform. These codelabs are built using the Meson build system, making it easy for learners to set up and follow along.

## Codelab Overview:

- **Title:** Creating Dynamic Content with Fossil Logic Libraries in FLLP
- **Objective:** Learn how to integrate Fossil Logic Libraries into the Fossil Learning Platform for dynamic and engaging educational content.
- **Duration:** Approximately 30 minutes

## Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Fossil Logic Libraries (FLL).
- Familiarity with the Meson build system.
- Have Python 3 on your host system

## Codelab Structure:

1. **Introduction to FLLP Integration:**
   - Overview of FLLP and its role in creating interactive learning materials.
   - Explanation of how FLL can be seamlessly integrated into FLLP.

2. **Setting Up the Codelab Environment:**
   - Meson build system setup: `meson setup builddir`.
   - Compilation of the codelab project: `meson compile -C builddir`.

3. **Creating Custom Libraries with FLL:**
   - Steps to define and create custom libraries using FLL.
   - Guidance on structuring libraries for educational content.

4. **Integrating FLL into FLLP:**
   - Detailed instructions on integrating FLL libraries into FLLP.
   - Demonstration of how FLL enhances interactive components within educational materials.

5. **Building and Testing the Codelab Project:**
   - Utilizing Meson for building and testing the codelab project.
   - Verifying the integration of FLLP and FLL libraries.

6. **Publishing Your Interactive Codelab:**
   - Steps to publish and share your codelab with others.
   - Tips for creating engaging and dynamic content for educational purposes.

## Fossil Updater tool

If you want to install a tool to help manage Meson and Ninja build installations feel free to to use our Fossil Logic Tool for managing updates Fossil Updater:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dreamer-coding-555/fossil-updater.git
```

This command will download the project and install it without the need to clone the repository first.

## Conclusion:

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the "Creating Dynamic Content with Fossil Logic Libraries in FLLP" codelab. Feel free to adapt this template for your own codelabs, exploring different aspects of FLLP and FLL.

Happy coding and learning with Fossil Logic and FLLP! ðŸš€
